# Breast-Cancer-Prediction
This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of breast cancer based on medical data. Our goal is to develop an accurate and reliable predictive model that can assist healthcare professionals in early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer, ultimately improving patient outcomes.

# Introduction
Early detection of breast cancer can significantly improve the chances of successful treatment. This project leverages machine learning to develop predictive models that can assist healthcare providers in diagnosing breast cancer at an early stage.

# Installation
git clone https://github.com/your-username/breast-cancer-prediction.git
cd breast-cancer-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Usage
1. Run the data Pre-processing script:
  -> python preprocess_data.py
2. Train the models:
   -> python train_models.py
3. evaluate the models:
   -> python evaluate_models.py



# We have implemented various machine learning algorithms, including:

1.Logistic Regression
2.Decision Trees
3.Random Forests
4.Support Vector Machines (SVM)
